# rtems-docker
A collection of Docker files for the RTEMS RTOS tools and BSP builds

Simiar to the RTEMS repositories, the branches support different versions of RTEMS.
The default, or "main" branch supports the master branches of RTEMS tools and kernel source
The "rtems4.11" branch supports RTEMS 4.11
The "rtems5" branch supports the RTEMS 5 branch of the tools and RTEMS source

As new releases of RTEMS are made, the main will advance and a branch will be made for the release branch (rtems6 for example)
